			<p>Course taken at Bellevue College:</p>
			<p>Name: Fundamentals of Web Development</p>
			<p>Class Code: PROG 109</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/PROG/109" target="_blank">PROG 109 Class Catalog</a>
			<p>Instructor: Adam Brehm</p>
			<br>
			<p>Before taking this class, I did not know how to code in html, css, or javascript. While taking this class, I have gotten a little more comfortable
			   coding pages and asking for help when needed. Over this course, I want to be able to completely understand web development so I can create my own websites.
			   After taking this class, I have learned that coding is about understanding how a page is created and how it works. As for skills, I am learning javascript
			   right now, a little hard to grasp to be honest, but I have professor that is willing to sit down 1-1 and help me. I have also learned to communicate a lot
			   better. Before, I was too afraid to be judged by my questions, afraid that I would look stupid. Now, I just ask the class through our group chat. This class
			   has made be a little bit more confident in the academic area.</p>
